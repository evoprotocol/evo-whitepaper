## Overview

In essence by _acceleration_ and _deceleration_ (i.e. **velocity**) that the speed of the ERC20 token transfers (e.g. average transaction rate/mean transaction rate) can help to _counter-balance_ and reduce the market price volatility of the faster base currency (\$ETH). Our focus is on purely-virtual crypto currencies, which are based on computational assets e.g. as BTC, which is based on "mining", or ETH, which is based on computational "GAS".

> _Note_ We call this _Embedded Transactional Optionality_

## Token Value

Traditionally, commodities (e.g. like precious and rare metals) or assets of much lesser liquidity or even fully illiquid assets (all of which are not without their own limitations), GasEVO approximates its value by utilizing the unit of account- **block time**.

> _Note_ A more accurate representation would be _acceleration_ and _deceleration_ of the velocity of liquidity 


## Utility

Given enough liquidity (assuming frequent transactions) GasEVO has a way to compute the `exchange rate` towards the base instrument (ETH). Like this, movements of the bigger or significant volumes can be interpreted as market trends (i.e. higher gwei pricing.)

By utilizing small volume movements and disincentivizing the larger ones without compensation to holders every exceeding unusual trade of the token is tracked by the smart contract and higher "interest" fees are applied (re: withdraw, or 'consumption').

Transference of funds _below_ daily volume threshold does not impose any interest fee.

When the threshold has been exceeded some percentage of tokens gets burned, for the transfer, for deposit or for withdraw of the base instrument (ETH).

Thresholds are tracked individually per address as the average rate and have a function by which they operate on.
